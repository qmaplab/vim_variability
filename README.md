Please add the main directory to your MATLAB path. You will need to be running v2019 or later.

To recreate the main results and tables, in the main matlab prompt type "run_vim_analysis" or "results=run_vim_analysis". This will create a results array with all the data and statistical results. It will also write a local copy of the results to the main directory, and a logfile.
